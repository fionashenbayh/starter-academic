# Interests to show in About widget

My research broadly examines the institutional dimensions of autocracy, including the legal and judicial instruments of autocratic rule as well as the challenges of promoting access to equitable justice in the Global South. Focusing on sub-Saharan Africa, my work draws on a mixed-methods approach that combines qualitative and quantitative analyses.
